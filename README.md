Final Test Advanced C# Class - Humber College 

Problem #1
Write a generic class that meets the following requirements:

1)   That constrains a developer to only instantiate the class based on value types

2)   Contains a private generic collection

3)   Has a method to add items to the private collection

4)   Has a method that will return an item from the list (e.g. item 3 or item 4 in the list)

5)   Has a method that returns a sorted collection with the items in descending order

Problem #2 

Write c# classes for events, one class which exposes an event and another which handles the event.

Choose any scenario you prefer to build your code.



1)   Create a class to pass as an argument for the event handlers (EventArgs class)

2)   Set up the delegate for the event

3)   Declare the code for the event

4)   Create code the will be run when the event occurs (Event Handler)

5)   Associate the event with the event handler
